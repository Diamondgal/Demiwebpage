                I have a BA in Graphic Design which I obtained from USC.  During my degree,  I developed a strong relationship with the University that led to me providing free lance design services to them for 15 years.  Most recently I become a Digital and Social Media Marketer servicing various clients in multiple industries. The flexibility as a free-lancer allowed me to work as an Agent in other companies including Arise Virtual Solutions and LiveOps.  I am energetic, strong-minded , have a diligence for hard work and love meeting new people and discovering cultures. I thrive in environments of mutual learning and skills sharing.

                    I am mother to 16 year old Kyle - the most beautiful boy in the world.  My passions, (besides learning to code &#128521;) are cooking, knitting and painting.  I enjoy the serenity of silence. To keep my body healthy, spinning is my go to and I've recently discovered the joy of working out on my Total Gym and Piyo. My top goal at the moment is SUCCESSFULLY completing the Bootcamp course I am enrolled in. I am the owner of a food truck that sells my specilaity Hawaiian Shaved Ice and New Orleans sno' balls.  I am growing the menu food offering to inlcude mini pancakes. Food is a passion and it's defintely one of love languages.

                People who love to eat are always the best people...Julia Child (I love her so much) <br>
                Realistic is the path for mediocrity (Will Smith...I love him so much). <br>

                I am an abstract thinker and go against the ordinary or predictable.&copy; Copyright 2019
